# Performing analyses and visualizing results

Now that we've seen how to create a connectome for an individual subject,
we're ready to think about how we can use this connectome in a machine learning analysis.
We'll keep working with the same `development_dataset`,
but now we'd like to see if we can predict age group
(i.e. whether a participant is a child or adult) based on their connectome,
as defined by the functional connectivity matrix.

We'll also explore whether we're more or less accurate in our predictions based on how we define functional connectivity.
In this example, we'll consider three different different ways to define functional connectivity
between our Multi-Subject Dictional Learning (MSDL) regions of interest (ROIs):
correlation, partial correlation, and tangent space embedding.

To learn more about tangent space embedding and how it compares to standard correlations,
we recommend {cite}`Dadi_2019`.

## Load brain development fMRI dataset and MSDL atlas

First, we need to set up our minimal environment.
This will include all the dependencies from the last notebook,
loading the relevant data using our `nilearn` data set fetchers,
and instantiated our `NiftiMapsMasker` and `ConnectivityMeasure` objects.

```{code-cell} python3
:tags: [hide-output]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nilearn import (datasets, input_data, plotting)
from nilearn.connectome import ConnectivityMeasure

development_dataset = datasets.fetch_development_fmri(n_subjects=30)
msdl_atlas = datasets.fetch_atlas_msdl()

masker = input_data.NiftiMapsMasker(
    msdl_atlas.maps, resampling_target="data",
    t_r=2, detrend=True,
    low_pass=0.1, high_pass=0.01).fit()
correlation_measure = ConnectivityMeasure(kind='correlation')
```

Now we should have a much better idea what each line above is doing!
Let's see how we can use these objects across many subjects,
not just the first one.

## Region signals extraction

First, we can loop through the 30 participants and extract a few relevant pieces of information,
including their functional scan, their confounds file,
and whether they were a child or adult at the time of their scan.

Using this information, we can then transform their data using the `NiftiMapsMasker` we created above.
As we learned last time, it's really important to correct for known sources of noise!
So we'll also pass the relevant confounds file directly to the masker object to clean up each subject's data.

```{code-cell} python3
children = []
pooled_subjects = []
groups = []  # child or adult

for func_file, confound_file, phenotypic in zip(
        development_dataset.func,
        development_dataset.confounds,
        development_dataset.phenotypic):

    time_series = masker.transform(func_file, confounds=confound_file)
    pooled_subjects.append(time_series)

    if phenotypic['Child_Adult'] == 'child':
        children.append(time_series)

    groups.append(phenotypic['Child_Adult'])

print('Data has {0} children.'.format(len(children)))
```

We can see that this data set has 24 children.
This is roughly proportional to the original participant pool,
which had 122 children and 33 adults.

We've also created a list in `pooled_subjects` containing all of the cleaned data.
Remember that each entry of that list should have a shape of (168, 39).
We can quickly confirm that this is true:

```{code-cell} python3
print(pooled_subjects[0].shape)
```

## ROI-to-ROI correlations of children

First, we'll use the most common kind of connectivity--and the one we used in the last section--correlation.
It models the full (marginal) connectivity between pairwise ROIs.

`correlation_measure` expects a list of time series,
so we can directly supply the list of ROI time series we just created.
It will then compute individual correlation matrices for each subject.
First, let's just look at the correlation matrices for our 24 children,
since we expect these matrices to be similar:

```{code-cell} python3
correlation_matrices = correlation_measure.fit_transform(children)
```

Now, all individual coefficients are stacked in a unique 2D matrix.

```{code-cell} python3
print('Correlations of children are stacked in an array of shape {0}'
      .format(correlation_matrices.shape))
```

We can also directly access the average correlation across all fitted subjects using the `mean_` attribute.

```{code-cell} python3
mean_correlation_matrix = correlation_measure.mean_
print('Mean correlation has shape {0}.'.format(mean_correlation_matrix.shape))
```

Let's display the functional connectivity matrices of the first 3 children:

```{code-cell} python3
_, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
for i, (matrix, ax) in enumerate(zip(correlation_matrices, axes)):
    plotting.plot_matrix(matrix, colorbar=False, axes=ax,
                         vmin=-0.8, vmax=0.8,
                         title='correlation, child {}'.format(i))
```

Just as before, we can also display connectome on the brain.
Here, let's show the mean connectome over all 24 children.

```{code-cell} python3
plotting.view_connectome(mean_correlation_matrix, msdl_atlas.region_coords,
                         edge_threshold=0.2,
                         title='mean connectome over all children')
```

## Studying partial correlations

Rather than looking at the correlation-defined functional connectivity matrix,
we can also study **direct connections** as revealed by partial correlation coefficients.

To do this, we can use exactly the same procedure as above, just changing the `ConnectivityMeasure` kind:

```{code-cell} python3
partial_correlation_measure = ConnectivityMeasure(kind='partial correlation')
partial_correlation_matrices = partial_correlation_measure.fit_transform(
    children)
```

Right away, we can see that most of direct connections are weaker than full connections for the first three children:

```{code-cell} python3
_, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
for i, (matrix, ax) in enumerate(zip(partial_correlation_matrices, axes)):
    plotting.plot_matrix(matrix, colorbar=False, axes=ax,
                         vmin=-0.8, vmax=0.8,
                         title='partial correlation, child {}'.format(i))
```

This is also visible when we display the mean partial correlation connectome:

```{code-cell} python3
plotting.view_connectome(
    partial_correlation_measure.mean_, msdl_atlas.region_coords,
    edge_threshold=0.2,
    title='mean partial correlation over all children')
```

## Using tangent space embedding

An alternative method to both correlations and partial correlation is tangent space embedding.
Tangent space embedding uses **both** correlations and partial correlations to capture
reproducible connectivity patterns at the group-level.

Using this method is as easy as changing the kind of `ConnectivityMeasure`

```{code-cell} python3
tangent_measure = ConnectivityMeasure(kind='tangent')
```

We fit our children group and get the group connectivity matrix stored as
in `tangent_measure.mean_`, and individual deviation matrices of each subject
from it.

```{code-cell} python3
tangent_matrices = tangent_measure.fit_transform(children)
```

`tangent_matrices` model individual connectivities as
**perturbations** of the group connectivity matrix `tangent_measure.mean_`.
Keep in mind that these subjects-to-group variability matrices do not
directly reflect individual brain connections. For instance negative
coefficients can not be interpreted as anticorrelated regions.

```{code-cell} python3
_, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
for i, (matrix, ax) in enumerate(zip(tangent_matrices, axes)):
    plotting.plot_matrix(matrix, colorbar=False, axes=ax,
                         vmin=-0.8, vmax=0.8,
                         title='tangent offset, child {}'.format(i))
```

We don't show the mean connectome here as average tangent matrix cannot be interpreted,
since individual matrices represent deviations from the mean, which is set to 0.

## Using connectivity in a classification analysis

We can use these connectivity matrices as features in a classification analysis to distinguish children from adults.
This classification analysis can be implmented directly in scikit-learn,
including all of the important considerations like cross-validation and measuring classification accuracy.

First, we'll randomly split participants into training and testing sets 15 times.
`StratifiedShuffleSplit` allows us to preserve the proportion of children-to-adults in the test set.
We'll also compute classification accuracies for each of the kinds of functional connectivity we've identified:
correlation, partial correlation, and tangent space embedding.

```{code-cell} python3
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

kinds = ['correlation', 'partial correlation', 'tangent']
_, classes = np.unique(groups, return_inverse=True)
cv = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=15, random_state=0, test_size=5)
pooled_subjects = np.asarray(pooled_subjects)
```

Now, we can train the scikit-learn `LinearSVC` estimator to on our training set of participants
and apply the trained classifier on our testing set,
storing accuracy scores after each cross-validation fold:

```{code-cell} python3
scores = {}
for kind in kinds:
    scores[kind] = []
    for train, test in cv.split(pooled_subjects, classes):
        # *ConnectivityMeasure* can output the estimated subjects coefficients
        # as a 1D arrays through the parameter *vectorize*.
        connectivity = ConnectivityMeasure(kind=kind, vectorize=True)
        # build vectorized connectomes for subjects in the train set
        connectomes = connectivity.fit_transform(pooled_subjects[train])
        # fit the classifier
        classifier = LinearSVC().fit(connectomes, classes[train])
        # make predictions for the left-out test subjects
        predictions = classifier.predict(
            connectivity.transform(pooled_subjects[test]))
        # store the accuracy for this cross-validation fold
        scores[kind].append(accuracy_score(classes[test], predictions))
```

After we've done this for all of the folds, we can display the results!

```{code-cell} python3
mean_scores = [np.mean(scores[kind]) for kind in kinds]
scores_std = [np.std(scores[kind]) for kind in kinds]

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
positions = np.arange(len(kinds)) * .1 + .1
plt.barh(positions, mean_scores, align='center', height=.05, xerr=scores_std)
yticks = [k.replace(' ', '\n') for k in kinds]
plt.yticks(positions, yticks)
plt.gca().grid(True)
plt.gca().set_axisbelow(True)
plt.gca().axvline(.8, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('Classification accuracy\n(red line = chance level)')
plt.tight_layout()
```

This is a small example to showcase nilearn features. In practice such
comparisons need to be performed on much larger cohorts and several
datasets.
{cite}`Dadi_2019` showed that across many cohorts and clinical questions,
the tangent kind should be preferred.

Combining nilearn and scikit-learn can allow us to perform many (many) kinds of machine learning analyses,
not just classification!
